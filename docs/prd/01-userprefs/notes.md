# User Preferences Notes

- Only render the shaded gutter when values go outside the preferences
- Always show the preference lines
- Revise gutter color to match the chart color - with 20% opacity
- Need to extract the preference logic into a higher order helper that can determine the segments of the chart that are in and out of range - this should then be used to drive an overall summary which reports the times that are OK.
- Preference form is way to wide and spacey - put the label and input in the same line. make it all much tighter.
