# User Preferences Notes

- Get a summary of the times that are WITHIN the preferences - list the time ranges where the values are within the preferences -- report this as the top of the weather card
- For each weather metric, report the percentage of time that the values are within the preferences
- Add a minimum duration that needs to be met before it is considered to be within the preferences - default to 1 hour - allow user to input in decimal hours
