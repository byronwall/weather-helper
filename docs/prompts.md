## Build a plan

Create a `plans.md` file to include an actual implementation plan. Where it makes sense, add interface details and comp outlines (file structure + main props and actions).

Add a STATUS section at bottom that will collect the progress. Fill with an initial status reflecting all work that needs to be done. Mirror the structure shown below (do not use this content).

Structure:

```
## Status

### Phase 1: Sidebar Component

- [ ] Basic sidebar structure
  - [ ] Component scaffolding
  - [ ] Basic styling
  - [ ] Responsive layout

... and so one

## Current Progress

- Bullet list of all work completed

### Next steps

- Bulleted listed of all work remaining

```
